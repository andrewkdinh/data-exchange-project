7/7/2020 21:57:44,Female,,john denero,cs 61a,Male,he is a very good lecturer! good at answering questions and also getting back to you if you have any concerns about the class
7/7/2020 21:58:06,Female,,Nicholas Mattews,Music 27,Male,"Anyone can tell that he's very knowledgeable and cares about the subject. He also clearly cares about his students by accommodating to any feedback, creating extra office hours, and just being a friendly person. "
7/7/2020 22:03:22,Female,,Eric Siegel,Nature and Human Studies,Male,"never gets grading done. we turned in an essay two months before the end of the semester and we never got it back, we STILL wrote another essay after that one tho. we also did a lot of busy work which he would barely grade. he was a kind dude but damn, grade? don’t know her."
7/7/2020 22:24:22,Male,19,Denero,Ssssssssssixty one A,Male,10/10 would take again
7/7/2020 23:30:08,Male,18,Seth Lunine,Geography 70AC,Male,"This man really knew what he was talking about. Might have had a boring style, but the amount I learned in his class was truly unapproachable. He should be nominated for one of the most knowledgeable teachers of his era. "
7/7/2020 23:36:50,Female,19,Arman Catterson,Psych 101,Male,Super chill professor. Handled the transition to online school last semester very well and makes every effort to be understanding of student situations. Was somehow able to make the 3 hour omg lecture bearable and taught in a clear way breaking down difficult concepts into manageable bites.
7/8/2020 0:38:16,Male,20,Ken Ribet,Math 110,Male,"Professor Ribet is a mathematician who's an expert in his field. He led the way for the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem -- though he wasn't the actual one to prove it. In his class, we are all scholars and no question is a stupid one. On the very first lecture of Math 110 I had with him, he asked all 200 of us in his class to write a paragraph about who we are and why we enjoy math. The next class meeting, he responded with a personalized message to every one of us regarding our self biography. He tries hard to remember every one of his students' names, and he sets up faulty brunches with students to have some one-on-one time to talk with us. Incredibly approachable, he wants us to succeed, he BELIEVES we will succeed, and he's a master of his art and incredibly renowned in his field. He also is good friends with Axler, the author of the textbook for Math 110. Aaaaaand he's the first math professor I've known that always drinks a glass of wine during our Zoom lectures. He's a great person and a brilliant professor. "
7/8/2020 1:33:00,Female,19,Omar Hernandez Javier ,UGBA 146,Male,"Really helpful and accommodating. He values understanding in a way not limited to numbers, but rather discuss the content with students so to provoke them to think rather than simply memorizing materials. He is always so cheerful and invites open discussion on anything from 'is anyone getting married today' to curriculum concepts.He is always so cheerful and happy whenever he greets students - great attitude. "
7/9/2020 21:20:51,Male,19,Paul Hilfinger,Comp Sci 61B,Male,"Professor Hilfinger is clearly knowledgeable about the subject matter of the course, but is very non engaging in lecture. He is so unentertaining that in a class of over 1000 students, he managed to turn a full lecture hall at the beginning of the semester into a near empty lecture hall by the middle of it. As someone who went to many lectures, his lectures are pretty dense and hard to follow and I witnessed a lot of students falling asleep. Thus, the projects and other assignments are the main source of learning in this class are challenging but rewarding. In the end, the class is manageable if you reach out to support such as friends taking the class or potentially going to office hours and project parties. Even if not from the lecture or Hilfinger himself, I did learn a lot in this class about programming and data structures and how to build a programs from scratch.  "
7/9/2020 21:32:47,Female,19,Kevin Van Houston ,ESL 006B,Male,"He was the amazing professor and teaches the class that was step by step in his class. However, he has to responsible the grade, assignment, and exam for his student also. I love that proffessor for the year in Elac."
7/9/2020 21:38:09,Female,20,McClendon ,EMS20,Female,The most badass motherfucker who ever did live 
7/9/2020 21:42:27,Male,21,Adam Perry,COMM-128,Male,Dr. Perry was Awesome!  He was very knowledgeable and passionate about the subject and always had ways of making class fun!  I never felt like the class was ever impossible and he made me want to do well
7/9/2020 21:45:07,Female,19,P. T.,Statistics ,Female,"Caring and flexible. First time to teach at our university + online due to the pandemic, but prepares self-explanatory powerpoints and adjust assignment amounts and grading systems flexibly according to our requests."
7/9/2020 21:45:17,Female,22,Dr. McGinnis,general Genetics PCB3063,Female,"Professor was un-accommodating during COVID-19, considering this course was 6 weeks long over the summer. She would not answer students questions in depth and would refer to the book for us students to learn and to teach ourselves. Her lectures were pre-recorded and class time was spent for asking questions which she never went into great detail about the material. Exams were hard because there was so much information to study in such a little bit of time (6 weeks) and she did not provide any help on what to study for/ how to study. She would just reference the book and sample videos online. Worst professor I ever had. Even  emailed her about a conflict I had with one of her exam dates before class even started and she told me that if I was not available to take the exam at that exact time and date then I should consider dropping the course. Mind you the class hasn’t even started yet."
7/9/2020 21:59:30,Female,21,Munir Humayun,GLY 3039,Male,"His teaching was dynamic, appealing to multiple styles of learning while still being easy to understand. Although, the class required the student to put forth effort into their own individual study, Professor Humayun did his best to ensure that students did well in his class. Really an all around wonderful person and professor."
7/9/2020 22:07:34,Female,29,Soleymani,Math54,Male,Good!

7/9/2020 22:22:51,Female,35,Dr. Davey,Sociology,Female,The best Professor and Chair of Sociology Dept 
7/9/2020 22:36:30,Female,20,Balabainian ,BIO40A ,Female,Prof Balabanian really cared about all of her students and did not have any favorites. She clearly wanted every student to succeed in her class. She made sure she helped everybody have the materials they needed to do well in exams and was communicative 
7/9/2020 22:50:57,Female,18,Mrs. Holly Wenham,Calc I,Female,She is a very nice person who makes learning in the classroom very easy. She uses many examples and always makes sure to go over questions.
7/9/2020 23:12:05,Female,21,Austin Wilkes ,ITA1101 and ITA1102,Female,"Austin Wilkes is one of the best professors I've had at FSU. She doesn't punish mistakes but uses them to teach us how to better understand Italian. She uses several different methods of teaching to help everyone understand. For example, if someone is a visual learner, she'll make a chart for them or get them a picture example. If they are an audio learner, she finds songs or videos in Italian to help us hear how the language flows. She goes over each quiz and test to help us where we struggle. She's very understanding and genuinely wants to help students learn Italian. "
7/9/2020 23:14:22,Male,20,Sahai,EE16B,Male,Cares a lot about students learning important stuff. Doesn't know how to express it in an empathetic or reflective way.
7/9/2020 23:29:56,Female,32,Dr.Stone,english composition,Female,She was inspiring in her love for literature.  She was so passionate about what she taught and so encouraging if her students. I measured all other teachers by her standard of excellence. 
7/9/2020 23:33:30,Male,19,John DeNero,Comp Sci 61A,Male,"Very engaging teacher that really as a passion for what he teaches. He managers such a large class very well, but I believe does not always have the best control over TA’s. Although most are great, he (or others from his department) have also chosen ones that are clearly unfit for the role. I believe he could also improve by taking more students in to account when determining difficulty of certain activities, instead of making unnecessarily difficult papers that only a few highly experienced CS students are able to achieve."
7/9/2020 23:35:55,Male,19,Michael Mahoney,Stat 89A,Male,"He was very careless with the class. He could focus more on quicker replies, and better structure overall."
7/9/2020 23:39:42,Female,20,Lilla Balint,German 156,Female,"She is very good in encouraging students to participate and a good leader of group discussions, however she lacks some organizational skills and confused me sometimes"
7/9/2020 23:43:53,Male,18,Emiliano Gomez,Math 53,Male,"He was a very decent professor but spoke too fast during lectures: it was hard to keep up. But over recorded lectures, it was possible to pause and absorb what he was saying and it made a lot more sense. He uses good examples and is very fair, but exams were tough"
7/10/2020 0:19:57,Male,20,Pantelis Vassilakis,Reca 220,Male,Extremely knowledgeable professor that does a good job simplifying complex concepts. Also extremely accessible for additional help and a cool guy who is easy to have a conversation with. 
7/10/2020 0:27:41,Male,18,Kelli Talaska,Math 53,Female,"Professor Talaska does not seem to care much about the well-being of her students, but I think she is an effective lecturer despite what many people say and I have learned Multivariable/Vector Calculus to a satisfying degree."
7/10/2020 0:33:17,Male,19,Richard Saykally,Chem 4B,Male,"He was a disaster. He spent way to much time on things that weren’t important or even about chemistry. He should’ve spent more time with examples and making sure we understood what he was teaching. Also, he made a midterm specific for us to fail."
7/10/2020 0:34:30,Female,18,Helen Bateup,MCB 165,Female,"I had Professor Bateup for neurobiology of disease. She explains the materials very clearly and presents everything in an engaging manner. The materials were very complex, but she makes it easy to understand."
7/10/2020 0:49:42,Female,26,Nadine Bermudez ,Chicano/a 47,Female,Passionate and cared for students success but was rude and not really opened to hear students opinions which made me feel anxious to participate in fear that she would shame me in front of the class. Although she came off rude she definitely lectured well I just wish she was a little friendly. 
7/10/2020 1:10:02,Male,19,Lane Martin,MAT SCI 45/45L,Male,"Lane Martin is an engaging and friendly professor, with a great level on knowledge on the topics he teaches, as well as interesting ideas that he can add based on his experience and research. Despite his assignments and exams being somewhat challenging, his class was extremely interesting and we gained a great deal of introductory knowledge to the field. "
7/10/2020 1:28:49,Female,18,Professor Lionelle,CS 150,Male,"Every lecture was intriguing and fun to attend. He found a way to make learning each concept fun and interactive, which thereby made it easier for the class to grasp the difficult concepts of beginning computer science. He gave inspirational talks that involved stories about how computer science is being used to create so many new concepts today. I think he was overalls my favorite professor. However, he did focus a lot on the history of computer science and it would’ve helped to spend more time learning harder to learn concepts in the class such as class inheritance and 2-D arrays."
7/10/2020 1:31:18,Female,18,Sara Magrin ?,Classic 36,Female,"Was very intense, very informed, very interesting, very Italian. I loved her class"
7/10/2020 1:48:21,Female,19,Poulomi Saha,English 80K,Female,"She was charismatic and engaging in person and still so understanding and great when we transitioned to remote learning. She may have been teaching an English class, but what we discussed impacted my thoughts and beliefs outside of class too in a larger context like gender, sexuality, politics, etc. "
7/10/2020 1:51:25,Female,18,Yukiko Hunter,Public Speaking,Female,"Her class was one that was extremely stressful for me because we had to present in front of the class, but the way she built a safe and comfortable space in the classroom really helped and I really appreciate her because of it."
7/10/2020 1:58:37,Female,19,Agnelo Menezes,Microeconomics,Male,"He strongly believed in applying the theory we learnt to practice. Continuously gave practical examples to help us understand concepts better. Often times, he went very fast for people to understand concepts fully. However, he was very approachable and would take extra time and effort to solve doubts.  "
7/10/2020 2:09:12,Male,19,Philip Wood,Math 53,Male,"Very articulate, fair prof. Would recommend for others to take his class."
7/10/2020 2:26:37,Female,18,Jac Asher,GWS 50AC,Female,Likely my favorite professor by far. Dr Asher was extremely friendly and welcoming in all of her interactions during lecture. She was a very genuine person and conveyed that through the dedication and passion in her work. Very grateful to have been taught by her.
7/10/2020 2:51:10,Male,19,Zvezdelina Stankova,Math 10B,Female,She was a fast moving professor who made the class much more difficult than it needed to be and was appropriate at the time due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This included making the commitment required for the class two times greater than it previously required. The class should’ve been counted for more units. She was impatient and would feel lost after every lecture and unable to approach her for help. 
7/10/2020 2:58:50,Female,27,Prof.  Dr. König,Strategic Management and Innovation,Male,"Mr. König is for me the only professor that I take courses at university that I honestly can describe as an example. He is so knowledgable and funny at the same time. His classes pass by really quickly. He is doing research on many interesting and new topics like digitalization, innovation, start-ups and entrepreneurship in general. "
7/10/2020 3:00:41,Female,30,Michelle Marchiano,ESL 273,Female,Take her class to improve your writing skill. She is a very good professor.
7/10/2020 3:16:42,Male,19,Dan Garcia,CS10,Male,Very caring and fun professor who tries very hard to make the class interesting and engaging
7/10/2020 3:34:31,Female,23,a professor of marketing communication - Devi,Marketing Communications,Female,"she is very keen, knowledgeable, clearly present and explain the subject to others, provide sufficient support during the assessment time "

7/10/2020 11:42:23,Male,19,Professor Kosek,Geog 10 AC,Male,"Kosek is extremely passionate about geography and gives engaging and informative lectures. The class changed how to view the world around me and made me think more deeply about why things are the way they are. However, Kosek struggles to enforce the readings, which results in lecture having more review than necessary for those that did do the readings."
7/10/2020 12:42:41,Female,39,Villavicencio ,Math125,Male,He was the best teacher for me after trying 3 times to pass this class he is very easy to understand and very flexible with students and the assignments were easy. He gave us resources to help us out and I highly recommend him.The best teacher I ever meet.
7/10/2020 14:21:49,Male,19,Charles Nyce,RMI 2302,Male,Great professor explained the course very well provided extra credit opportunities and made it virtually impossible to not pass. Tests were fair study and you will pass 
7/10/2020 14:31:41,Male,20,Min z ,ps 2,Male,was not helpful for office hours
7/10/2020 16:34:55,Female,19,John De Nero,CS 61A,Male,"I really like John! He cares a lot about his students and wants them to do well and learn a lot. He also makes really good lecture videos, which was helpful when we had to leave campus and do online school. His projects and exams are difficult, but you will learn a lot in his class! "
7/10/2020 19:59:06,Female,19,Paulin,Math 1B,Male,"Really fun guy that truly is passionate about calculus and math in general. Tried his best especially with the move online. Sometimes he overcomplicates things when he explains, but provides the students with lots of information and resources for success. "
7/11/2020 0:58:36,Female,19,Amir Hussain,Honors Theological Inquiry,Male,This was the best professor I have had at LMU thus far. He was compassionate towards student and wanted to get to know them. He was also EXTREMELY knowledgeable. It was awesome that I got to learn from him. I love how he incorporated things he loved into the course
7/11/2020 1:04:47,Female,19,Zvezda Stankova,Math 10B,Female,"Loved her! Her lectures were always fun and lively. However, she did have a tendency to move through the material very quickly. If you do her pdf readings before lectures its manageable though. "
7/11/2020 1:05:21,Male,20,MaryAnn Robak,"CHEM 3A, CHEM 3B",Female,"She was the best teacher I’ve ever had at Cal. She was understanding of her students’ needs, she effectively taught the material in a way that made it easy for students to learn, and she made sure to give us all the tools and materials we needed to successful get through her class. Professor Robak is such a kind and knowledgeable professor that I don’t know how I could have made it through the O-Chem series with her. "
7/11/2020 4:06:55,Female,21,Helian Ratsirarson ,ESCI 1,Female,Helian is a really good Professor and the assignments were quite easy to nail. 
7/11/2020 14:05:08,Female,19,Celeste Kidd,psych 147,Female,She was one of the best and most understanding professors. She’s always there to listen and willing to help. 
7/11/2020 16:15:29,Male,20,Gray,Chem 12A,Male,He's one of the best chemistry instructors I've ever taken. I took him for the entire organic chemistry sequence and he was excellent. 
7/11/2020 16:41:09,Female,19,ED 4A,Marcus Owens ,Male,"I trust that he has the knowledge to teach a module in the class but it's unfortunate that the delivery of the information is unorganized in transitioning from one idea to the next, spoken to quickly and loudly, and overall just hard to understand. Lack of presentation skills makes it hard to understand and learn. "
7/11/2020 17:10:25,Female,20,Caitlyn Rosenthal,History 133A,Female,"She did a great job engaging students in lecture, producing clear expectations and grading criteria, and choosing readings & course material that made the course interesting & useful. I wish the GSIs had had degrees that were more closely related to the course material, and I wish that the discussions during lecture were cut shorter sometimes. But overall, a really great class."
7/12/2020 14:28:31,Male,25,Mark Mueller,ME236U,Male,"Professor Mueller was a fantastic Professor. He organized the class around a semester long lab culminating in a class competition which both gave a backbone to the class and a sense of personal pride in the project. He gave students multiple avenues to learn by writing notes on a tablet, recording the class, and posting the recordings and PDFs as well as posting his formal types notes and additional practice problem sets. The homework was difficult but relevant to the material. My only gripe was he would often dive deep into the mathematical proofs behind certain algorithms - and I felt that he felt the need to mathematically prove everything, rather than let us take his word it was true. Otherwise, he was always very personal and welcoming in office hours and I enjoyed his class very much."
7/12/2020 19:50:03,Male,20,Dr. MaryAnn Robak,Chem 3B,Female,"MaryAnn is one of my favorite lecturers. She took a subject that many warned me about and taught it in a very clear way. The exams, although difficult, were always based on concepts from the lecture notes and problem sets. Her lectures weren’t boring but admittedly I would occasionally zone out. Lastly, the most important thing to know about her is that she cares a lot about her students’ success."
7/14/2020 21:28:04,Female,19,Arial baker gibbs,R1b,Female,She was a great professor!!! I loved learning in her class and she was very understanding of different and difficult circumstances
7/14/2020 21:41:15,Female,25,Holly Eklund,Calculus III,Female,"Holly Eklund is a great Calc 3 professor who organizes her material neatly and logically. Her course was very structured: a type of problem would be introduced and then she would go through multiple examples with increasing difficulty, which I found very helpful. However, her pace was extremely rigorous, so it was difficult to absorb the material while in class-- I found myself struggling to just keep up with writing down all of the examples and then having to review the material on my own time, which meant I couldn't ask questions in class. I think that the content of the class was thoughtfully chosen, but I would have like for there to have been more time to ask questions and think about the material while in class at the cost of one or two examples."
7/14/2020 22:21:05,Female,19,Dan Garcia,CS 10,Male,11/10 most caring and compassionate professor ever! You can feel his vibrant energy walking into the room! He knows his students and encourages everyone to participate and feel belonged in his class. Every staff in the class I've met are super sweet and patient! 
7/14/2020 23:56:08,Male,18,Kim Freeman,R4A: Stories in Sustainability,Female,Professor Freeman has great enthusiasm for the subject and expresses it quite well. I really enjoyed the selected texts in the classroom – a great mix between current relevant stories as well as some more abstract pieces that discuss the role of society and capitalism in the climate crisis. She also encouraged we visit museums to get a first hand look.
7/14/2020 23:59:20,Male,18,Christopher Grabowski ,The Acting Company,Male,I had him for the course stated above as well as my intro to drama course and he was one of the nicest most effective professors I have had in college. He makes every student feel apart of a company and is extremely easy to talk to.
7/15/2020 1:13:01,Male,19,Professor Stahler,Physics 7c,Male,Stahler was a fantastic professor! He really look the time to articulate difficult concepts in a way that any student could grasp. While we still had in person classes he would always do demonstrations that were very helpful. I appreciated his enthusiasm for the history’s of relativity quantum mechanics. He would often read excerpts from Einstein’s various books to the class!
7/15/2020 17:49:53,Male,19,W. Ethan Eagle,ENES100 (Engineering Design),Male,"Ethan was the first engineering professor I had at UMD, he taught my section of Engineering Design first semester of freshmen year. ENES100 was essential two things, intro to the engineering process and intro to mechatronic design, in which we worked in teams to build robotic platforms to perform multiple given tasks. Ethan was THE MAN. He had a great sense of humor and was very easy-going while teaching our engineering class. He was very approachable and willing to help out with every aspect of our robot, whether it was coding, circuitry, or the math behind the mechanical requirements of the robot. I think that Ethan, as well as our TA, were both able to connect with the students, making the effort to learn about the students' lives and academic careers. Overall, his ability to connect with myself and my classmates in a chaotic and fast-paced engineering class made him stand out among the professors I've had so far, and his great personality and sense of humor made him a fantastic teacher and person."
7/15/2020 23:38:24,Male,18,Alexander Paulin,Math 1B,Male,A very clear accommodating professor that strives to help his students learn the concepts of calculus at a deeper level. Gives a very reasonable amount of work through weekly homework assignments and provides many resources for help.
7/16/2020 10:30:33,Male,19,Todd Rossi,Engineering Mechanics: Statics,Male,"The class being set up in many different sections and for various schedules ,with nearly 600 hundred students in total, and 3 professors. The course also shared the same midterms as well as final, so the curriculum was based on a single powerpoint. My professor though creating the PowerPoint was disorganized and had primarily spent lecture answering questIons about homework problems from students who obviously skipped recitation where you ask these questions. The big problem was unlike the other professors, he took nearly 15-20 mins to answers a simple kinematics physics styled questions which happened every class period. Went it came to the slides with loss of time from before he had sped through barely covering the material. Instead of going to lecture I read the textbook and got an A.  As a professor he offered little to no engagement in the material, while also failing to cover the lecture in details and instead reading directly from the PowerPoint."
7/16/2020 12:22:50,Female,20,Debra Borkovitz,Math 242,Female,"She is a very personable professor, and she makes students feel comfortable. It is easy to talk to her and ask her questions. She mostly left students to their own devices and let us teach ourselves the material in small groups (the class only had about 30 people), but I wish she had taken the lead and given us more direction. "
7/16/2020 12:50:04,Female,20,Dave Sullivan,Comp Sci 111,Male,"He was VERY thorough and encouraged a lot of class participation, which was nice for a large class (around 150 people). Very nice guy, and wanted us all to succeed. "
7/16/2020 16:48:03,Female,19,Gentry Patrick,BILD 1,Male,"incredibly thorough and knowledgeable on the subject; lectures were detailed and provided real-world applications of concepts to demonstrate the opportunities for a career in the biological sciences. exams were representative of course material, and professor was very acclimating with the quick change to online learning. "
7/18/2020 12:37:00,Female,21,Thomas Kelley,CCJ 3032-Crime and Media,Male,"The professor did not have a course structure that required any actual learning, and urilized TA’s so frequently that I do not think I ever had communication with the professor. He failed to structure the course to be beneficial to students. That being said, he was very lenient with grades and chose a quality textbook for the course-too bad no one had to use it. His exams were all online, his discussion boards could be copied from other students in the course section, and the papers required for an upper-division writing course were laughable. "
7/19/2020 22:51:48,Female,19,Ana Paula Centeno,CS111 Introduction to Computer Science,Female,"Prof. Centeno is one of the best professors I have ever had. She has such a passion for computer science as well as helping students, which really shines through in the way she engages with people in her lectures. A huge lecture hall feels so personal with her as a teacher. She encourages all questions and is happy to expand upon topics when someone does not fully understand something. She's genuinely the best professor to have for someone without prior computer science experience. Her assignments could be confusing at times, but she was always prompt in her communication and clarified things adequately. We used Piazza to ask questions as well, which facilitated the communication after the quarantine. We had WebEx meetings which were recorded as well. Her communication skills and enthusiasm makes her a truly awesome professor."
7/20/2020 3:30:30,Female,18,Mylinh Pham,Hist 17A,Female,Best professor at De Anza College. I repeat BEST PROFESSOR! She's not only humorous but also very caring and wants her students to succeed.
